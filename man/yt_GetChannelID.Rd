Some YouTube channels have vanity names (sometimes referred to as legacy names)
in the channel URL instead of channel IDs.  The channel ID is needed to collect
any data from the channel, the API will not accept the vanity name.  This function
provides the channel ID for a channel, given the vanity name.
